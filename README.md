### Project Overview

 The Project involves implementation of various data exploration techniques such as :

•	Removing Missing Values

•	Cleaning Data

•	Exploring Data through various plots

•	Label Encoding

•	Feature Extraction


**Data Set 1 Information:**

This data set consists of three types of entities:

(a) the specification of an auto in terms of various characteristics
(b) its assigned insurance risk rating
(c) its normalized losses in use as compared to other cars.

The second rating corresponds to the degree to which the auto is more risky than its price indicates. Cars are initially assigned a risk factor symbol associated with its price. Then, if it is more risky (or less), this symbol is adjusted by moving it up (or down) the scale. Actuarians call this process "symboling". A value of +3 indicates that the auto is risky, -3 that it is probably pretty safe.
The third factor is the relative average loss payment per insured vehicle year. This value is normalized for all autos within a particular size classification (two-door small, station wagons, sports/speciality, etc…), and represents the average loss per car per year.
Note: Several of the attributes in the database could be used as a "class" attribute.
No of instances : 205
No of attributes : 26

**Data set 2 information:**
The data consists of technical specifications of cars. The dataset is downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository
Content: The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon, to be predicted in terms of 3 multivalued discrete and 5 continuous attributes
Number of Instances: 398
Number of Attributes: 9 including the class attribute

**Attribute Information:**

•	mpg: continuous

•	cylinders: multi-valued discrete

•	displacement: continuous

•	horsepower: continuous

•	weight: continuous

•	acceleration: continuous

•	model year: multi-valued discrete

•	origin: multi-valued discrete

•	car name: string (unique for each instance)

Missing Attribute Values: horsepower has 6 missing values
